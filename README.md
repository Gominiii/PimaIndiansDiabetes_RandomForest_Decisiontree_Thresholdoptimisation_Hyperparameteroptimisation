**Introduction**
In this project, we explore the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is a widely used dataset for diabetes prediction. We perform predictive modeling using Decision Trees and Random Forests, aiming to build accurate classifiers for diabetes detection. Additionally, we optimize hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance and fine-tune the classification threshold for better precision or recall.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the data directory.
You can find more information about the dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


**Usage**
The Jupyter Notebook Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb provides step-by-step guidance through the analysis, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and threshold optimization.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and reproduce the analysis. You can also adapt the code and techniques for your own projects.

**Results**
The analysis results, including model performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning outcomes, and threshold optimization results, are documented within the Jupyter Notebook. Please refer to the notebook for detailed insights and findings.
